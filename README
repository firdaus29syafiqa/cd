Research-y prototype of LLDB-based crash dumper.

Requires LLDB build in third_party/{bin/, include/, lib/, ...}, then 

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/third_party/lib
$ ulimit -c unlimited
$ ./m

This builds a little program that will crash, runs it, uses LLDB API to print
some information from the core file.

Currently, only works on Linux.
